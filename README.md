# Hello R2H Coding Grader!

This is my submission for the `Google Homepage Challenge | Guided Inquiry - HTML, CSS & JavaScript (week 2)` assignment. 

## Why I deserve a 4

I deserve a 4 because I have met all project requirements and fulfilled the optional challenges. I have implemented Google Search functionality and have made a page for Google Search, Google Image Search and Advanced Google Search. My code also allows users to navigate between pages in the same way Google.com does. 
I went above and beyond in self-learning, especially in regards to JavaScript. Using best coding practices in declaring variables at the top of the page and understanding the how and why in my JavaScript functions.
I have used problem solving in the entirety of this assignment and have learned something new along each step of the way. Over the course of this assignment, I have become more comfortable and adept in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## What's in this project?

← `README.md`: That's this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.

← `index.html`: This is the main web page for the site, a clone of the Google Homepage.

← `google_images.html`: This is an additional web page for the site, a clone of the Google Images Homepage. To get here, click on 'Images' in the top right of the `index.html` file

← `advanced_search.html`: This is an additional web page for the site, a clone of the Advanced Google Search Homepage. To get here, click on 'Advanced Search' in the drop-up menu when clicking on 'Settings' on the bottom right of either `index.html` or `google_images.html`.

← `style.css`: CSS files add styling rules to the content for `index.html`. The CSS applies styles to the elements in the HTML page.

← `styles.css`: CSS files add styling rules to the content for `google_images.html`. The CSS applies styles to the elements in the HTML page.

← `styless.css`: CSS files add styling rules to the content for `advanced_search.html`. The CSS applies styles to the elements in the HTML page.

← `script.js`: Adds interactivity to the site with JavaScript.

## Lessons Learned

- BEM and how useful it can be when writing CSS.
- Better understanding of the box-model.
- How to import and use images/icons.
- Padding vs Margin in regards to making a border.
- Box-shadow.
- JavaScript functions (new and old).
- Creating a drop-down/drop-up menu.
- Most importantly ~ how to problem solve with Google. Becoming better at knowing what to look up in regards to a problem and being able to dissect the information. I am having a better understanding of "what's happening under the hood" and using new information in my own words to solve my problems.
